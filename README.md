# Section 1: Description

## __About HOP__
 HOP is a client onboarding platform built for Hatchstone Capital. The application was built in order to streamline the onboarding process for Hatchstone and it's clients. With this software we reduced the amount of manual work involved for Hatchstone and it's clients. Moreover, we increased the speed of the onboarding processing, not to mention, creating greater transparency and clarity for Hatchstone to manage their clients' onboarding process. Lastly, the platform creates a significantly better user experience when it comes to onboarding, for both the clients and Hatchstone.
